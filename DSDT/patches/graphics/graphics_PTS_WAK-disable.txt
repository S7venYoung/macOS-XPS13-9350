# The purpose of this patch is to add code to to _WAK
# that disables Radeon/nvidia on wake and add code
# to _PTS that enables it on _PTS.
#
# The path of _OFF may have to be customized to match your SSDTs
# The patch attempts to identify the correct _REG by using
# the ACPI PNP identifier for the EC.
#
# Use this patch if you experience trouble shutting down
# or restarting your laptop when disabling nvida/radeon.
