#graphics_Rename-PCI0_GFX0.txt

# Note: Most DSDT/SSDTs use GFX0 for only the integrated graphics
#  device. But some use it for both the integrated device
#  at PCI0.GFX0 and the discrete device at PCI0.PEGP.GFX0.
#  This patch is for the latter scenario.

# Note: This patch is a minimalistic rename that only
#  touches PCI0.GFX0.  Useful for some machines
#  that have both a PCI0.GFX0 and PCI0.PEG.GFX0.
